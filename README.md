# GD50 Introduction to game dev
 This are my entries for the GD50 game dev course, A gamedev course from harvard. Although I am doing things differently, Firstly I am not doing the way they inteded, where you needed to submit your code and all that, the reason being that I don't really care. The other things I am doing differently is that I am using godot for all projects.
## Comeback
 I had pause this project to focus on other things, mainly personal aspects as well other games. Originaly, this was done in unity, but due to the unity controversy, I decided to stop using it and I changed to godot. Now I will remade everything in godot with c#

## Note
 Since godot 4 c# does not allow web builds, then I will only do downloads

Link to download: TBA

I am also planning doing other CS50 courses, mainly in this way, where I will do the way I want, not to discredit those who want to do the intented way, I just dont really care.

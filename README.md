# GD50 Introduction to game dev
 This are my entires for the GD50, A basic gamedev course from harvard. Although I am doing things differently, Firstly I am not doing the way they inteted to submited, the reason I am not doing that is because I dont really care. The other things I am doing differently is that I am using unity for all projects.

I am also planning doing other CS50 courses, manly in this way, where I will do the way I want, not to discredit those who want to do the intented way, I just dont really care about that.
